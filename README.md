### RL Swin Transformer for Ms. Pac-Man

This repository implements **Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Swin Transformer** in the **Ms. Pac-Man** environment. It compares Deep RL techniques such as **DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Split Q-Learning, and A2C/A3C**, with a focus on **Double DQN with Swin Transformers**.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reza-sf9/RL-Swin-Transformer.git
cd RL-Swin-Transformer
python -m venv rl_env
source rl_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
rl_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training
```bash
python train.py --env MsPacman-v5 --model swin_dqn --episodes 100000
```

### Evaluation
```bash
python evaluate.py --model swin_dqn --episodes 100
```

| Model               | Avg Score | Max Score |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| Standard DQN      | 2,769.9    | 6,380      |
| Double Dueling DQN | 3,734.4    | 7,900      |
| Split Q-Learning  | 3,052.7    | 5,000      |
| **Swin DQN**      | **4,285**  | **7,640**  |

### Future Work
- Extend training beyond 10,000 episodes.
- Optimize Swin Transformer inference speed.
- Fine-tune reward shaping for improved strategy.
